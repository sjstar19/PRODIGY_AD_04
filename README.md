TIC TAC TOE APP

**Tic Tac Toe App (Master Branch)**
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Kotlin for Android. The app allows two players to play the classic XO (Tic Tac Toe) game together in real-time. It features:
MVVM Architecture: Organized code for better maintainability.
UI Components: Buttons, TextViews, and ImageButtons.
ConstraintLayout: For responsive UI design.
Game Logic: Tracks player turns and checks for wins.

**What I Learned**
This project taught me several valuable lessons during my **Prodigy InfoTech** internship:
MVVM Architecture: I gained a deeper understanding of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and how it promotes separation of concerns in Android apps.
UI Design: Creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface is crucial. I learned how to use ConstraintLayout effectively for responsive layouts.
Event Handling: Managing button clicks and game logic required thoughtful event handling. I now appreciate the importance of handling user interactions efficiently.
Testing: While not explicitly mentioned in the code, I experimented with unit testing and learned about its significance in maintaining code quality.
